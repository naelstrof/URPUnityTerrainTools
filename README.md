# Terrain Brush Tools

![preview](preview.gif)

Some brush based tools that procedurally generate both a sealed mesh and texture mask for a terrain.

Everything's designed around the ability to move entire mountains around while keeping the mesh sealed and the texture fidelity maxed.

TODO: Some basic instructions on how to use it. This repo is under active development so instructions will change.

## Installation

Simply add `https://github.com/naelstrof/URPUnityTerrainTools.git#upm` as a package using the package manager.

Or if that doesn't work, add it to the manifest.json like so.

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.vilarnaelstrof.terrainbrushtools": "https://github.com/naelstrof/URPUnityTerrainTools.git#upm",
  }
}
```
